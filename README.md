# AI-Image-Detector Comparison

### Inentions:

The intention of this presentation is to compare various CNN methods in order to detect AI in images.


### Introduction
In a world of ever-evolving artificial intelligence, it is imperative that we have tools that allow us to differentiate between images taken in the real world and images crafted from artificial intelligence. From hyper-realistic synthetic media and deepfakes, there is growing concern over the authenticity and ethicality of various digital content.


### Motivation
To address the potential risks associated with AI-generated content, this project aims to develop a sophisticated model capable of accurately identifying whether an image is authentically captured or artificially curated. By enhancing detection capabilities, this initiative seeks to promote digital integrity and safeguard against misinformation.
